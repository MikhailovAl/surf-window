## Download and Run

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/MikhailovAl/surf-window/releases).
2. Download the `surf-window.zip` file (or `surf-window.dmg`).
3. Extract and drag `surf-window.app` into the `Applications` folder (or simply double-click the `.app` if you’re not moving it to `Applications`).
4. Launch the app – it will appear only in the status bar, with no Dock icon.
